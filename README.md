# shutdown
shutdown pc use python
When I shut down my Windows device normally, it wouldn't shut down completely.
I useing .bat file but change all time timing.
In this file, I can set the time as I want and it also uses a gui.
## Build
```
pyinstaller shutdown.py -F -w --version-file file_version_info.txt -n poweroff
```
